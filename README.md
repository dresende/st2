# Sublime Text 2

This is a repository with my user preferences and key bindings as well as
my plugins.

## Plugins

### Open Last Closed Files

Binding Ctrl+Shift+T to this plugin command ("open_last_closed_file"), the plugin will
behave just like in Firefox, opening the last files. For now, it can open the last 50
closed files (variable at the top of the plugin). Later on, I'll put this on settings.

### Git

This is not a git integration, this plugin will just be a couple of tweaks to make my
life easier. For instance, it displays the remote git repository on the status bar when
you have a git file opened, it will show you a colored diff of the changes of your file
from the last commit and will show you also a colored status of the current repository.
